# cat_dog_classification

* classification using KNN and SVM

* project - classification between cat and dogs. 
* reason of choise: i wanted to see if a machine could differentiate between somthing so trivial for us 
* note about the data: in order to get a clean data set, in the correct sizes i used a data set from kaggle : "Cats and Dogs image classification".
link to the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification

# how to run the program:
upload the data set to your google drive account (note- the train set has 20 images, while the test set has 10) <br/>
after doing so, change the directory.
